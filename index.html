      <p><strong>Lena Horne</strong> was a singer, actress and civil rights activist who first established herself as an accomplished live singer and then transitioned into film work. She signed with MGM studios and became known as one of the top African American performers of her time, seen in such films as <em>Cabin in the Sky</em> and <em>Stormy Weather</em>. She was also known for her work with civil rights groups and refused to play roles that stereotyped African American women, a stance that many found controversial. After some time out of the limelight during the '70s, she made a revered, award-winning comeback with her 1981 show <em>Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music</em>. <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lena_Horne" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.</p>
